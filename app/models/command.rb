If you want to be very careful, you can always add the username to your message but most of the times, that is not neccessary.\n\nYou can get a list of the people you have chat with by sending /friends. This will also tell you the person you currently have an active chat with. This is the person to whom any message you send that doesn't start with @username goes to. This will help you in case you are not sure who you are talking to.\n\nYou can also find some content on here to keep you informed and entertained. To get a random joke, send /jokes, for quotes, /quotes and for news, you have a few options. /news gives you local news while the rest are self explanatory: /news/international, /news/tech, /news/sport.\n\nWhen you request for content, if you had not saved this number in your contacts, the links won't appear and you won't be able to click them. So, please make sure you save this number.\n\nYou can also share a joke or a quote with a friend. Just send /jokes/@username or /quotes/@username. Spread the love. :-)\n\nAnd, finally, you can invite your friends by sending /invite/254722111777. Phone number must be in that format.
